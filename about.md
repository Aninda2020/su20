## Q&A

### Course Logistics

**Q. Where and when is class?**

**A.** Data 100 is offered in Summer Session C, from June 22 - August 14th. 

Data 100 will be taught entirely online this summer, as campus has moved to online instruction for Summer Sessions. Lectures and discussion sections will be pre-recorded and posted online, and in-person instruction time will be replaced with office hours and lecture recap.


---

**Q. How many exams will there be? When will they be? Will there be alternates offered?**

**A.** There will be 2 midterm exams, currently scheduled for July 9th and July 27th. These dates and times are tenative, and very well could change. There will also be a final exam, tentatively scheduled for some time on August 13th.

We will offer alternate exams for anyone who shows proof of an unavoidable conflict (another exam, plane tickets) at the discretion of the instructors, as well as for students in time zones vastly different than Pacific Daylight Time.

The exact format of these exams is to be determined; it depends on what campus decides is acceptable in terms of remote proctoring.

### Enrollment 

**Q. What is the course code?**

**A.** For Summer 2020, undergraduate enrollment will be handled by the Computer Science department, as CS C100. Make sure to enroll in this, and not in Stat C100.

---

**Q. What are the official prerequisites for this course? Will they be enforced?**

**A.** The official list of prerequisites are:

- Data 8.

- CS61A or CS88 or Engineering 7. We strongly recommend either CS61A or CS88.

- EE16A or Math54 or Stat89A. This may be satisfied concurrently with DS100, but we strongly recommend that you finish a linear algebra course before taking DS100.

The official prerequisites will not be enforced in terms of enrollment. However, we expect knowledge from the official prerequisites for the course itself.

**Q. On the course enrollment, I noticed that students are unable to enroll in a lab/discussions section. For the enrollment process, will students mark the "TBA" option in order to enroll and once they are accepted into the course will they get to choose a lab/discussion section?**

**A.** We won't be assigning students to actual discussion or lab sections due to the online nature of the course. We will be using the time that was allocated for labs and discussions as office hours.

## Goals

- Prepare students for advanced Berkeley courses in data-management, machine learning, and statistics, by providing the necessary foundation and context
- Enable students to start careers as data scientists by providing experience working with real-world data, tools, and techniques
- Empower students to apply computational and inferential thinking to address real-world problems

## Prerequisites

While we are working to make this class widely accessible we currently require the following (or equivalent) prerequisites. **We are not enforcing prerequisites during enrollment. However, all of the prerequisties will 
be used starting very early on in the class. It is your responsibility to know the material in the prerequisites.**:

- **Foundations of Data Science**: [Data8](http://data8.org) covers much of the material in DS100 but at an introductory level. Data8 provides basic exposure to python programming and working with tabular data as well as visualization, statistics, and machine learning.
- **Computing**: _The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_ ([CS 61A](http://cs61a.org)) or _Computational Structures in Data Science_ ([CS 88](https://cs88-website.github.io)). These courses provide additional background in python programming (e.g., for loops, lambdas, debugging, and complexity) that will enable DS100 to focus more on the concepts in Data Science and less on the details of programming in python.
- **Math**: _Linear Algebra_ (Math 54, [EE 16a](http://ee16a.org), or Stat89a): We will need some basic concepts like linear operators, eigenvectors, derivatives, and integrals to enable statistical inference and derive new prediction algorithms. This may be satisfied concurrently to DS100.

## About Data 100

Combining data, computation, and inferential thinking, data science is redefining how people and organizations solve challenging problems and understand their world. This intermediate level class bridges between [Data8](http://data8.org) and upper division computer science and statistics courses as well as methods courses in other fields. In this class, we explore key areas of data science including question formulation, data collection and cleaning, visualization, statistical inference, predictive modeling, and decision making.â€‹ Through a strong emphasis on data centric computing, quantitative critical thinking, and exploratory data analysis, this class covers key principles and techniques of data science. These include languages for transforming, querying and analyzing data; algorithms for machine learning methods including regression, classification and clustering; principles behind creating informative data visualizations; statistical concepts of measurement error and prediction; and techniques for scalable data processing.
