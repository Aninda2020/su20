- **Homeworks:** Homeworks are usually assigned twice every week (see Projects below). They must be completed individually and will mix programming and short-answer questions. Homeworks have both visible and hidden autograder tests. The visible tests are mainly sanity checks, e.g. a probability is <= 1, and are visible to students while they do the assignment. The hidden tests generally check for correctness, and are invisible to students while they are doing the assignment. Your lowest homework score will be dropped.
- **Labs:** Labs are assignments that complement the homeworks. There will be two lab assignments every week. All lab autograder tests are visible. Your four lowest lab scores will be dropped. 
- **Surveys:** Weekly check-ins to gauge and receive student feedback, via Google Forms.
- **Projects:** Projects are week-long assignments that synthesize multiple topics.
- **Midterms:** There will be two midterms. Midterm 1 will be on Thursday, July 9th. Midterm 2 will be on Monday, July 27th. See Piazza for more details.
- **Final:** The final exam is required, and will be split into two days. The first part will be on Wednesday, August 12th. The second part will be on Thursday, August 13th.

## Late Policy
All assignments are due at 11:59 pm on the due date specified on the syllabus.

**Homeworks and labs will not be accepted late.**

Projects are marked down by 10% per day, **up to two days**. After two days, project submissions will not be accepted. 

## Exam Makeup Policy 
We will have alternate exams for people with academic conflicts. Alternate exams will tentatively be held on the same day as the regular exam. Details to be announced. 


## Collaboration Policy (don’t cheat)
Data science is a collaborative activity. While you may talk with others about the homework, we ask that you write your solutions individually in your own words. If you do discuss the assignments with others please include their names at the top of your notebook. Keep in mind that content from the homework and vitamins will likely be covered on both the midterm and final. We will be following the [EECS departmental policy on Academic Honesty](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/students/academic-dishonesty), so be sure you are familiar with it.
