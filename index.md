# Data 100, Summer 2020

**Instructors:** Suraj Rampure (<a href="mailto:suraj.rampure@berkeley.edu">suraj.rampure@berkeley.edu</a>) and Allen Shen (<a href="mailto:allenshen5@berkeley.edu">allenshen5@berkeley.edu</a>) 

Feel free to contact the instructors with any questions. But first, please read the Frequently Asked Questions below.
 

<br>

We **will** be offering this course online over the summer. More details, as they become available, will be posted here.

<!-- ## Course Logistics -->

---
<!-- 
**Q. Where and when is class?**

**A.** Data 100 is offered in Summer Session C, from June 22 - August 14th. Starting on June 22, lecture will be held Monday through Thursday, from 9:30AM - 11:00AM, in Hearst Mining 390.

In addition, there will be discussion sections on Mondays and Wednesdays, and lab sections on Tuesdays and Thursdays. For a full list of discussion and lab times, check the [official classes.berkeley.edu listing](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-summer-compsci-c100-001-lec-001).

**Q. Will attendance be required?**

**A.** No.


---

**Q. How many exams will there be? When will they be? Will there be alternates offered?**

**A.** There will be 2 midterm exams, currently scheduled for July 9th and July 27th in lecture. These dates and times are tenative, and very well could change. There will also be a final exam, tentatively scheduled for some time on August 13th.

We will offer alternate exams for anyone who shows proof of an unavoidable conflict (another exam, plane tickets), at the discretion of the instructors.

---

**Q. Will there be webcasts/lecture videos?**

**A.** No, Summer Sessions courses are unfortunately not recorded. For some lectures, the instructors may choose to record their lecture manually and post it, but you should not rely on this.

## Enrollment 

---

**Q. What is the course code?**

**A.** For Summer 2020, undergraduate enrollment will be handled by the Computer Science department, as CS C100. Make sure to enroll in this, and not in Stat C100.

---

**Q. What are the official prerequisites for this course? Will they be enforced?**

**A.** The official list of prerequisites are:

- Data 8.

- CS61A or CS88 or Engineering 7. We strongly recommend either CS61A or CS88.

- EE16A or Math54 or Stat89A. This may be satisfied concurrently with DS100, but we strongly recommend that you finish a linear algebra course before taking DS100.

The official prerequisites will not be enforced in terms of enrollment. However, we expect knowledge from the official prerequisites for the course itself.


---

**Q. On the course enrollment, I noticed that students are unable to enroll in a lab/discussions section. For the enrollment process, will students mark the "TBA" option in order to enroll and once they are accepted into the course will they get to choose a lab/discussion section?**

**A.** All students will enroll in a single lab/discussion section (the 'generic' 999 section), and at the beginning of the semester we will assign students to sections using some method. -->
