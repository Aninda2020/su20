# Data 100, Summer 2020

**Instructors:** Suraj Rampure (<a href="mailto:suraj.rampure@berkeley.edu">suraj.rampure@berkeley.edu</a>) and Allen Shen (<a href="mailto:allenshen5@berkeley.edu">allenshen5@berkeley.edu</a>) 

Feel free to contact the instructors with any questions. But first, please read the Frequently Asked Questions below.

## Course Logistics

---

**Q. Where and when is class?**

**A.** Data 100 is offered in Summer Session C, from June 22 - August 14th. 

Data 100 will be taught entirely online this summer, as campus has moved to online instruction for Summer Sessions. Lectures and discussion sections will be pre-recorded and posted online, and in-person instruction time will be replaced with conceptual office hours and lecture recap.

That is, from Monday through Thursday from 9:30-11AM, there will be conceptual office hours on Zoom. (These will be in addition to other office hours, primarily for assignment help.)


---

**Q. How many exams will there be? When will they be? Will there be alternates offered?**

**A.** There will be 2 midterm exams, currently scheduled for July 9th and July 27th. These dates and times are tenative, and very well could change. There will also be a final exam, tentatively scheduled for some time on August 13th.

We will offer alternate exams for anyone who shows proof of an unavoidable conflict (another exam, plane tickets) at the discretion of the instructors, as well as for students in time zones vastly different than Pacific Daylight Time.

The exact format of these exams is to be determined; it depends on what campus decides is acceptable in terms of remote proctoring.

## Enrollment 

---

**Q. What is the course code?**

**A.** For Summer 2020, undergraduate enrollment will be handled by the Computer Science department, as CS C100. Make sure to enroll in this, and not in Stat C100.

---

**Q. What are the official prerequisites for this course? Will they be enforced?**

**A.** The official list of prerequisites are:

- Data 8.

- CS61A or CS88 or Engineering 7. We strongly recommend either CS61A or CS88.

- EE16A or Math54 or Stat89A. This may be satisfied concurrently with DS100, but we strongly recommend that you finish a linear algebra course before taking DS100.

The official prerequisites will not be enforced in terms of enrollment. However, we expect knowledge from the official prerequisites for the course itself.


---

**Q. On the course enrollment, I noticed that students are unable to enroll in a lab/discussions section. For the enrollment process, will students mark the "TBA" option in order to enroll and once they are accepted into the course will they get to choose a lab/discussion section?**

**A.** We won't be assigning students to actual discussion or lab sections due to the online nature of the course. We will be using the time that was allocated for labs and discussions as office hours.
