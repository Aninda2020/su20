Hi, my name is Paul, currently a junior studying EECS. Some of my personal hobbies include classical music, hiking, and traveling. Data 100 is a really cool course in that it has really gone above and beyond many other similar courses to teach hands-on problem-solving skills and how to apply all the theoretical knowledge taught in class to real-life scenarios, without any intentional simplifications. I hope you enjoy the class as much as we do and gain something valuable out of the materials to further your academics, researches, and careers!
