Hi, I’m Sona! I recently finished my undergrad and I’m currently a 5th year masters student doing research in the RISE lab. I took DS100 the first time it was offered and this is my 6th time TAing it! I enjoy photography, traveling, eating, and meeting new people. I look forward to a great semester! :)
