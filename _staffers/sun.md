Hi, I'm Jocelyn and I'll be finishing both my CS and CogSci major in the upcoming fall semester. Hit me up if you want to know how I became friends with my neighbors' cats without any physical contacts, my adventure in pan-frying everything, or my experiments with all the cocktail recipes I could find on the internet!! Data 100 is one of my favorite courses I've ever taken, I hope you will find this class enjoyable too ðŸ™‚
