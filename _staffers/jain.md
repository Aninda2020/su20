Hi I'm Rahul, a third year studying Computer Science & Applied Mathematics from Los Angeles (Go Lakers!) In my free time, I like rooting for my sports teams: Lakers, Packers, working out at the gym, playing Super Smash with my roommates (come to my discussion/lab to find out who my main is) and hanging out with friends. Come talk to me how the Lakers are winning the chip this year
