Hi guys, I’m James! I’m a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Data Science from Jakarta, Indonesia. In my free time, I enjoy playing Civilization, binge-watching YouTube, and exploring different foods in Berkeley. DATA 100 is definitely one of my favorite classes, and I hope it becomes yours too! Looking forward to a great semester with you all!!
