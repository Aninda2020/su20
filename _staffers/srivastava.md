Hey everyone, Iâ€™m a Junior from Mumbai majoring in data science, and this will be my third semester as TA. My interests include food, hiking, and comedy, so feel free to hit me up with your recommendations for restaurants, hiking trails, and standup specials. 

You can ask me about the class too (I guess)
