Hey, I'm Suraj! I'm a senior EECS major from Windsor, Ontario, Canada 🇨🇦. This is my seventh semester as a GSI, and fourth for Data 100. Talk to me about teaching, my dog Junior, being Canadian (listening to Drake, eating Tim Hortons, living in an igloo etc.) or about how LeBron (the 🐐) will lead the Lakers to the title this year.
