## About Data 100


Combining data, computation, and inferential thinking, data science is redefining how people and organizations solve challenging problems and understand their world. This intermediate level class bridges between [Data8](http://data8.org) and upper division computer science and statistics courses as well as methods courses in other fields. In this class, we explore key areas of data science including question formulation, data collection and cleaning, visualization, statistical inference, predictive modeling, and decision making.​ Through a strong emphasis on data centric computing, quantitative critical thinking, and exploratory data analysis, this class covers key principles and techniques of data science. These include languages for transforming, querying and analyzing data; algorithms for machine learning methods including regression, classification and clustering; principles behind creating informative data visualizations; statistical concepts of measurement error and prediction; and techniques for scalable data processing.

### Goals

- Prepare students for advanced Berkeley courses in data-management, machine learning, and statistics, by providing the necessary foundation and context
- Enable students to start careers as data scientists by providing experience working with real-world data, tools, and techniques
- Empower students to apply computational and inferential thinking to address real-world problems

### Prerequisites

While we are working to make this class widely accessible, we currently require the following (or equivalent) prerequisites. **We are not enforcing prerequisites during enrollment. However, all of the prerequisties will be used starting very early on in the class. It is your responsibility to know the material in the prerequisites.**:

- **Foundations of Data Science**: [Data8](http://data8.org) covers much of the material in Data 100 but at an introductory level. Data8 provides basic exposure to python programming and working with tabular data as well as visualization, statistics, and machine learning.
- **Computing**: _The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_ ([CS 61A](http://cs61a.org)) or _Computational Structures in Data Science_ ([CS 88](https://cs88-website.github.io)). These courses provide additional background in python programming (e.g., for loops, lambdas, debugging, and complexity) that will enable Data 100 to focus more on the concepts in Data Science and less on the details of programming in python.
- **Math**: _Linear Algebra_ (Math 54, [EE 16a](http://ee16a.org), or Stat89a): We will need some basic concepts like linear operators, eigenvectors, derivatives, and integrals to enable statistical inference and derive new prediction algorithms. This may be satisfied concurrently to Data 100.

## Grading Policies

Scores in the course are assigned according to the following weights:

| Category | Weight | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Homeworks | 28% | 4% each (8, with 1 drop) |
| Labs | 10% | 1% each (14, with 4 drops) |
| Surveys | 2% | 0.5% each (8, with 0 drops) |
| Projects | 12% | 6% each (2, with 0 drops) | 
| Midterm 1 | 12% |  |
| Midterm 2 | 12% | |
| Final | 24% | two days, 12% each day |

| **Grading Scheme** |

| 28% Homeworks (4% each – 8, with 1 drop) <br>  10% Labs (1% each – 14, with 4 drops) <br> 2% Surveys (0.5% each) <br>12% Projects (6% each) <br> 12% Midterm 1 <br> 12% Midterm 2 <br> 24% Final | -->

- **Homeworks:** Homeworks are usually assigned twice every week (see Projects below). They must be completed individually and will mix programming and short-answer questions. Homeworks have both visible and hidden autograder tests. The visible tests are mainly sanity checks, e.g. a probability is <= 1, and are visible to students while they do the assignment. The hidden tests generally check for correctness, and are invisible to students while they are doing the assignment. Your lowest homework score will be dropped.
- **Labs:** Labs are assignments that complement the homeworks. There will be two lab assignments every week. All lab autograder tests are visible. Your four lowest lab scores will be dropped. 
- **Surveys:** Weekly check-ins to gauge and receive student feedback, via Google Forms.
- **Projects:** Projects are week-long assignments that synthesize multiple topics.
- **Midterms:** There will be two midterms. Midterm 1 will be on Thursday, July 9th. Midterm 2 will be on Monday, July 27th. See Piazza for more details.
- **Final:** The final exam is required, and will be split into two days. The first part will be on Wednesday, August 12th. The second part will be on Thursday, August 13th.

### Late Policy
All assignments are due at 11:59 pm on the due date specified on the syllabus.

**Homeworks and labs will not be accepted late.**

Projects are marked down by 10% per day, **up to two days**. After two days, project submissions will not be accepted. 

### Exam Makeup Policy 
We will have alternate exams for people with academic conflicts. Alternate exams will tentatively be held on the same day as the regular exam. Details to be announced. 


### Collaboration Policy (don’t cheat)
Data science is a collaborative activity. While you may talk with others about the homework, we ask that you write your solutions individually in your own words. If you do discuss the assignments with others please include their names at the top of your notebook. Keep in mind that content from the homework and vitamins will likely be covered on both the midterm and final. We will be following the [EECS departmental policy on Academic Honesty](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/students/academic-dishonesty), so be sure you are familiar with it.
